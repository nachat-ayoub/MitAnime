# MitAnime

## About this project:
MitAnime is an anime website that provides Arabic-translated anime content free from ads based on WitAnime/Anime4up Scraped Data. It was developed using the MERN Stack, which includes MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, and Node.js. The website offers a collection of anime series and allows users to browse, search, and watch their favorite shows. The project was completed within a week. The source code is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/nachat-ayoub/Mitanime), there is a [Frontend](https://github.com/nachat-ayoub/Mitanime/tree/frontend) & [Backend](https://github.com/nachat-ayoub/Mitanime/tree/backend) branches, and you can visit the live demo [here](https://mitanime.netlify.app/). but if there is an error loading Anime data it's due to the API being down because of the free hosting.
