# MitAnime

## About this project:
MitAnime is an anime website that provides Arabic-translated anime content free from ads based on MitAnime/Anime4up Scraped Data. It was developed using the MERN Stack, which includes MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, and Node.js. The website offers a collection of anime series and allows users to browse, search, and watch their favorite shows. The project was completed within a week. The source code is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/nachat-ayoub/Rewayati), and you can visit the live demo [here](https://mitanime.netlify.app/). but unfortunately it's not working right now due to the API being down because of heroku.

## Technologies used:
- MERN Stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js)
- Sass (Styling)
- Web Scraping
- Frontend Development
- Backend Development
